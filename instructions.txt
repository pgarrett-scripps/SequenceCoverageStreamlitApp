This repo will contain a streamlit applciations which accepts files which 
contain peptide sequences. 1 per line. It also accepts a protein sequence.

Using peptacular (https://peptacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/peptacular.html#module-peptacular.sequence.sequence_funcs)
can you generate sequence coverage matrixes for each uploaded file. Then create a plot using plotly, which will have
the amino acids as the x axis, and then the y axis will be each file uploaded. I would like to have horizontal bars
to depict the sequence coverage for each filetype.

Create app.py as well as a requirements.txt file and readme
